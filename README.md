- **Remove Books**: Allows the removal of books from the inventory if they are no longer available or needed.
- **Display Books**: Users can view a list of all books in the library, including their details, helping to keep track of the collection.
- **Edit books**: Users can edit the book, finding it first by ISBN, show the current values of the book and then allow the user enter new values for the book.
### 2. Patron Management:
- **Register Patrons**: The system allows librarians to register new patrons, capturing essential information like name, ID, and contact details.
- **View Patrons**: Librarians can view a list of registered patrons, making it easier to manage user information.

### 3. Borrowing and Returning Books:
- **Borrow Books**: Patrons can borrow books from the library, and the system will track which books are currently checked out and which are available.

- **Books per Patron**: this option will show the number of current (borrowed-returned) books borrowed by Patron and which are those books.
### 4. Search Functionality:
- The system allows users to search for books by title, author, or ISBN, making it easy to find specific books in the library's collection.
- The system allows users to search for patrons by id and it will show the information about the Patron, including how Many books, he has been borrowed.
 
### 5. User-Friendly Interface:
- The application features a simple text-based menu that guides users through the available operations. This design makes it accessible for users with varying levels of technical expertise.
